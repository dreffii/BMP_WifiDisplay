- Config your display at user setup of TFT_eSPI library
- Upload Code to ur esp32
- Config wifi via serial terminal
- If you want to change wifi, over serial terminal type SET_WIFI, and you are able to set new wifi. This maybe glitchy duo to my sketchy coding skill. Well at least I get this to work.

- This works on TFT Display ST7789 with or without cs pin
